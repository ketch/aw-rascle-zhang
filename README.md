This is an effort to check computations done by Benjamin Seibold using the AWR
traffic model.

The .gif files show results obtained using the Riemann solver in rp1_arz_traffic.f90.
The HLL Riemann solver is not yet debugged.
Neither solver works well on the constant velocity Riemann problems studied in Ref. 2.
